How to install
========================

Copy the tarball to $HOME/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions
and unpack it. A directory called websearch@ciancio.net
should be created. 

For use by all users, install in /usr/share/gnome-shell/extensions ().

Restart your GNOME shell (Alt-F2 r is one way) and enable the
extension using gnome-tweak-tool (install it if not present).

If the extension does not install, check the version number in
metadate.json. You may have to change it to work with your
particular version of the GNOME Shell. If this does not fix
the problem, use Looking Glass (Alt-F2 lg) to see what the
error message is.


Other Info
========================

Copy the string to search in your clipboard (CTRL+C) and click on the find icon.

A new tab opens in your preferred browser with results from your preferred search engine.

You can search for text in clipboard (left click) or bring up settings menu (right click).
